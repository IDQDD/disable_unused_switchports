# glue all playbooks together

# 1. finds unused ports
#- import_playbook: inventory.yml
# first playbook creates VARs for other playbooks but ansible doesn't hand them over
# so the inventory playbook can't be combined with others and should be running separately

# 2. shuts down unused ports in CICSO gears
- import_playbook: cisco-shut.yml
# 3. shuts down unused ports in HUAWEI gears
- import_playbook: hw-shut.yml
